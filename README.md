### Setup config
Setup path for skin, beatmap, replay, default skin and ffmpeg in `osr2mp4/config.json`


`"Start time": 0, "End time": 60` means it will only convert the first minute of the replay.
Set `"End time"` to -1 if you want to convert full replay.

`"Process": 2` means the program will use 2 processes to convert so it will be faster than just 1.
Use `"Process": 0` if you don't want parallel computing.

### Run tests
```
osr2mp4-core$ python -m unittest discover -s tests -p *test.py
```
